 WinUI3 Bundle Maker

An MSIX bundle is made up of multiple MSIX packages and it can reduce the size of the app that users download. App bundles are helpful for different architectures, language-specific assets, varying image-scale assets, or resources that apply to specific devices. By bundling multiple architectures versions of your application into one entity, only the bundle needs to be uploaded to your distribution location (instead of having one for each architecture).

 currently visual studio can not bundle winui 3 app, so you can use this app and bundle your winui 3 app into msixbundle file
